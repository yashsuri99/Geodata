Using the Google Places API with a Database and
Visualizing Data on Google Map

In this project, we have a file where.data which conatins the name of universities all over the world along with there longitude and latitudes data.
When we run the geoload.py all the data is read from where.data file and is put in an sqlite file. 
After running geoload.py followed by running geodump.py then using the Google geocoding API
to clean up some user-entered geographic locations of universities names and then placing the data on a Google Map.
At the last an html link is created which links to the Google Map marking all the locations of the universities on the map given to us.
